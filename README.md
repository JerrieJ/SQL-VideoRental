# SQL-VideoRental

# Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company, is facing stiff competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. To stay relevant, Rockbuster Stealth is planning to leverage its extensive movie licenses to launch an online video rental service. As part of this initiative, a data analyst in the business intelligence (BI) department is tasked with analyzing data to support the launch strategy and answering ad-hoc business queries from various departments.

# Project Objectives
The primary task is to load Rockbuster's existing data into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and use SQL for analysis. The management team has posed several key questions that need data-driven answers to shape their 2020 company strategy:

# Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
